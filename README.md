This repository contains my old website which was hosted on my school's server. This website was supposed to be used to host lab assignments for my CISC 3110(Advanced Programming Techniques in C++) class. But no labs were really assigned except for the first one. So I used this as a playing ground for messing around with HTML/CSS throughout the semester.
